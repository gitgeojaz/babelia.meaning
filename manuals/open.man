              Perform nearest point walk using only pixels of the same color with mouse position as a starting point (the default). Left click to lock the result in place, click again to unlock.

              Perform nearest point walk without animations. Left click to lock the result in place, click again to unlock.

              Draw lines using pixels of the same color. Left click to select color, drag mouse pointer around with the left button pressed to create a stroke. Drag a line backwards through the most recent point to unstick it. Press 'Z' to undo the stroke, 'Y' to redo, 'D' to clear all strokes and deselect color (no undo!).

       [36m-b[0m, [36m--bookmark[0m, [36m-m[0m=[32mb[0m, [36m--mode[0m=[32mbookmark[0m, ...
              Display bookmark contents. This option is set automatically if a bookmark with the given filename or index is detected. Left click to edit bookmark in draw mode.

       [31m--METRIC_NAME[0m, [36m--metric[0m={[32ml1[0m | [32ml2[0m | [32mlinf[0m | [32mcos[0m}
              Metric to use in the nearest point walk (default [32ml2[0m). Play around and see what results each metric yields.

       [36m-c[0m=[31mX,Y[0m, [36m--coords[0m=[31mX,Y[0m
              Set starting point coordinates for the nearest point walk manually. In draw mode select pixels with the same color as the starting one.

       [36m-i[0m, [36m--intersect[0m
              Allow line self-intersections in the nearest point walk. This setting forces the process to utilize all the available pixels of the same color.

       [36m--speed[0m=[31mSPEED[0m
              Set bookmark animation speed in range 0.1-10 (default [31m1[0m).

       [36m-p[0m, [36m--points_disable[0m
              Do not highlight points in bookmark mode.

       [36m--scale[0m=[31mSCALE[0m
              Set image scaling (integer >=1, default [32mauto[0m).

       [36m-t[0m=[31mMILLISECONDS[0m, [36m--time_limit[0m=[31mMILLISECONDS[0m
              Set time limit for the nearest point walk computation (default [31m500[0m). This is an advanced setting, increase only if timeout error is encountered.
